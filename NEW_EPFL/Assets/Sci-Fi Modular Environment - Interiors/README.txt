HOW TO USE:

Drop prefabs in your scene, that's it.
Hold V on your keyboard to snap vertices in order to stick walls or floors to each other.
Learn more about that here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/tips/snapping

To achieve the same effects you could see on screenshots you need to use Unity Post Processing tools. The preset I was using is stored in "PostProcessingPreset" folder.
